# react-scripts


This is a fork of the package react-scripts from create-react-app v4.0.3
We forked so we could change the babel-loader version to bring it up to
date with other packages we are using


This package includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>
Please refer to its documentation:

- [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) – How to create a new app.
- [User Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.
